## Object
The aim of the game is to avoid rolling 1s and to be the first player who reaches 100 points or more.

## Play
On your turn throw the die:
- If you roll a 1, you lose your turn and do not score.
- If you roll any other member, you receive the corresponding points.

As long as you receive points you can throw again, and again. You may throw as often as you wish. Your turn ends in one of two ways:
- If you decide to finish your turn before you roll a 1, score your accumulated points. These points are now safe for the rest of the game.
- If you roll a 1, you lose your turn and your accumulated points.
